# Fifth Promotional Task: FastAPI API Collection

This repository contains a collection of five independent FastAPI-based APIs, developed as part of the KodeCamp Fifth Promotional Task. Each task is an isolated project demonstrating key concepts of API development in Python, including Pydantic models, CRUD operations, data persistence, and modular design.

## Tasks

- [**Task 1: Student Result Management API**](task_1_student_api/README.md)
  - An API to manage student records, compute grades, and persist data to `students.json`.

- [**Task 2: Mini Shopping API with Cart**](task_2_shopping_api/README.md)
  - A shopping cart API that manages products, a shopping cart, and handles checkout with data stored in `products.json` and `cart.json`.

- [**Task 3: Job Application Tracker API**](task_3_job_application_tracker/README.md)
  - An API to track job applications, with data persistence to `applications.json` and a restricted status field using Python's `Enum`.

- [**Task 4: Notes App API**](task_4_notes_app/README.md)
  - An API for a notes application, managing each note as a separate file on the local file system.

- [**Task 5: Simple Contact API**](task_5_simple_contact_api/README.md)
  - A simple contact management API with in-memory data storage and a search endpoint using query parameters.
